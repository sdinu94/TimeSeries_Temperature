# TimeSeries_Temperature
Trend Analysis and Seasonal Variation of Temperatures using Time-Series Methods. We would predict the average monthly temperatures for the chosen city (or country) in the last decade by using the city &amp; country level data over the previous 150 years. The difference between the predicted average monthly temperatures and the actuals would give us the residuals. A trend analysis of the residuals would help us identify the rise in temperatures and find the effect of Global Warming in Chicago
